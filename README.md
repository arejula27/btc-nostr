## Geting started

Before running the program you must configure it. Change the name of
`conf.template` to `conf` and edit ALL the fields, if you miss someone the program could fail
or have a unexpected behaviour. 
For running use `go build` on the project root directory and then run the executable. At 
this moment the conf file must be on the same directory as the executable.
